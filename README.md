Species Data Visualization
==========================

This project takes 40 species's gene representations and outputs a grid-based GUI that visualizes distance of one species's gene with all the other 39 species's genes. Its implementation is based on the SpeciesParser repo.

###Disclaimer:

Only several files are works of mine; the ones labeled by other authors are files provided by the course staff to facilitate the setting.
